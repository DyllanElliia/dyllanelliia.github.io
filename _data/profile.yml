  I am a first-year PhD student at the Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC), Shandong University (SDU), advised by <a href="https://irc.cs.sdu.edu.cn/~chtu/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Changhe Tu</a> and <a href="https://manyili12345.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Manyi Li</a>. I am also a member of the joint PhD program ('TONG Program') with Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI), and I am grateful to be advised by <a href="https://jeasinema.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Xiaojian Ma</a>. Previously, I got my Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from SDU in 2025 and Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from UESTC in 2022.
